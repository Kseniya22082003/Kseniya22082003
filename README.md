- 👋 Hi, I’m Kseniya 
- 👀 I am cheerful girl interested in learning programming, but at the same time I am quite a versatile person :) I am keen on reading both scientific and fiction literature, communicating with people, being physically and mentally active.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for data analysis and web development. Surely you will ask me... why python and not another programming language? Well, I'll answer 😊 As for me, Python is great for getting to know coding for a beginner. It is well structured and logical. But as I mentioned earlier, development is a key value, so in the near future I plan to expand my skills not only in learning this programming language.
- 💞️ I would be glad to collaborate on any fascinating progect to get a new experience!
